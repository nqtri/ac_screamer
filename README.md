# ac_screamer

A script that uses Twilio API to send notifications to phone if a given item on Costco is in stock.

Initial intention for this script is to detect stock status of a Danby Portable AC on Costco.ca for the recent heatwave in Vancouver, BC but it can be used on any item available on Costco.ca and later on can be expanded to other retailers.

Notiifcations are sent to phone via Twilio REST API so a Twilio account is required.

Original script was developed by Arya Boudaie and available on www.aryaboudaie.com.
